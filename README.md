# 🌦️ Qt Weather App

A modern, minimalistic weather application built using **C++ and Qt** (QtWidgets), developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project.

It fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays it in a simple yet elegant UI with support for **automatic location detection** using IP.
